This folder should contain the .APN files with the lemmatisation.

The name of the files is supposed to follow the format:

Author_Book_ShortName.APN

For example:

Horatius_CarmenSaeculare_HorSaecu.APN

For "historic" reasons, the *Consolation ad Liviam* is the last book from Ovid, to reproduce the same results, rename the file in such a way that it comes after the *Remedia Amoris*, for example rename it to:

Ovidius_ZZZConsolatioadLiviam_OviConsLiv.APN
